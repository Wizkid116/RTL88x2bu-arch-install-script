# WARNING!
This repository is now depricated seeing as I no longer need this script. If any errors arise from this script, I probably won't fix them!
# RTL88x2bu-arch-install-script
A script that automates the install process for the RTL88x2bu driver for linux.

This specific script is designed to run on Arch-based distros, but I might write more for different distros(assuming if I make this repo public).
# Installation
Download the .sh file, open a terminal in the same directory, and type ./Install-RTL88x2bu.sh

And that's it :)
